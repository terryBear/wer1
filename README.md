### Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the GraphQL API using a tool like GraphQL Playground or your preferred GraphQL client.

### GraphQL Playground
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4000 to access the GraphQL Playground. Here, you can explore and interact with the GraphQL API, run queries, and test mutations.

### Additional Configurations
If you need to customize configurations or integrate with Apollo Studio, please refer to the relevant sections in the code and update the necessary files.

### Issues and Contributions
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

Enjoy building with GraphQL and Apollo Server!
